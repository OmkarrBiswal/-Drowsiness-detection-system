# -Drowsiness-detection-system
Developed a computer vision system for monitoring driver fatigue using OpenCV and deep learning
Implemented real-time eye tracking with 95% precision and analyzed facial landmarks using dlib's 68-point model and 
Achieved a 92% accuracy rate in drowsiness detection with an average response time of 0.3 seconds.
Technologies Used: OpenCV, dlib, deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow or Keras), Python.
